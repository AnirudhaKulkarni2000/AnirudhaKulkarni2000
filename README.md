💫 About Me:
I currently work across social impact, government collaboration, and health-tech products, balancing both technical execution and product strategy.

At Apurva, an AI-powered platform that helps NGOs achieve their goals through technology and data-driven insights, I work in a DevOps-focused role. I manage CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins), cloud deployments, authentication systems, databases, and overall infrastructure, while also contributing to application-level improvements when needed.

In parallel, I serve as a Product Manager for Invest UP, a government collaboration initiative designed to help investors connect seamlessly with government stakeholders. In this role, I drive product planning and execution while working closely with the tech stack, including React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, ensuring technology decisions align with user and stakeholder needs.

Beyond my professional roles, I am also building a personal health-tech application called SAANVI, which stands for:

Smart AI Assitant for Nutritional and Vital Information

SAANVI is a mobile application focused on diet tracking, workout management, and overall health optimization, designed to act as an intelligent personal wellness assistant.
